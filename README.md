| **Object**      | Can hold any data type      | `Dim anyValue As Object = "Hello"` | 🎭 |

---

### 💻 **Declaring Variables with Data Types**  
In VB.NET, variables are declared using the `Dim` keyword, followed by the variable name and its data type.  

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Dim variableName As DataType
```

**Examples**:  
```vb.net
Dim age As Integer = 25          ' 🔢 Stores whole numbers
Dim name As String = "Alice"     ' ✍️ Stores text
Dim pi As Double = 3.14159       ' 🧮 Stores floating-point numbers
Dim isActive As Boolean = True   ' ✅ Stores true/false values
Dim letter As Char = "A"         ' 🔤 Stores a single character
```

---

### 🌟 **Choosing the Right Data Type**  
- Use **Integer** for whole numbers.  
- Use **Double** for precise decimal values.  
- Use **String** for text.  
- Use **Boolean** for conditions (`True` or `False`).  
- Use **Date** for working with date and time.  

---

## 📦 **Namespaces in VB.NET**  

A **Namespace** is a container that holds classes, interfaces, structures, and other namespaces. It helps organize code and avoids naming conflicts by grouping related types together. Namespaces allow you to use the same class names in different parts of the program without causing clashes.

---

### 1. **Declaring a Namespace** 🏷️  

To declare a namespace, use the `Namespace` keyword followed by the name of the namespace. Inside the namespace, you define your classes, modules, or other components.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Namespace NamespaceName
    ' Code goes here
End Namespace
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Namespace MyNamespace
    Class MyClass
        Sub Greet()
            Console.WriteLine("Hello from MyNamespace!")
        End Sub
    End Class
End Namespace
```

---

### 2. **Using a Namespace** ⚡  

Once a namespace is declared, you can use the classes or functions inside it by referencing the namespace. This is done using the `Imports` statement at the beginning of your code.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Imports NamespaceName
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Imports MyNamespace

Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Dim obj As New MyClass()
        obj.Greet()  ' 🖨️ Output: Hello from MyNamespace!
    End Sub
End Module
```

---

### 3. **Nested Namespaces** 🔁  

Namespaces can also be nested inside other namespaces. This allows for better organization, especially in larger programs.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Namespace OuterNamespace
    Namespace InnerNamespace
        ' Code goes here
    End Namespace
End Namespace
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Namespace OuterNamespace
    Namespace InnerNamespace
        Class MyClass
            Sub DisplayMessage()
                Console.WriteLine("Message from Nested Namespace!")
            End Sub
        End Class
    End Namespace
End Namespace
```

---

### 4. **Using Fully Qualified Names** 📍  

To avoid naming conflicts, you can refer to a class using its fully qualified name, which includes the namespace and class name.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
NamespaceName.ClassName
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Dim obj As New MyNamespace.MyClass()
        obj.Greet()  ' 🖨️ Output: Hello from MyNamespace!
    End Sub
End Module
```

---

### 5. **System Namespace** 🌐  

The **System** namespace is the root namespace in the .NET Framework and contains fundamental classes for working with data types, collections, file I/O, and more.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Imports System

Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the System namespace!")  ' 🖨️ Output: Welcome to the System namespace!
    End Sub
End Module
```

---

### 6. **Common Namespaces in VB.NET** 🔑  

Some commonly used namespaces in VB.NET are:

- **System**: Contains fundamental classes like `String`, `Console`, and `DateTime`.
- **System.IO**: Used for file and stream handling.
- **System.Collections**: Provides classes like `List`, `Dictionary`, and `ArrayList` for working with collections.
- **System.Linq**: Provides classes and methods for Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).
- **System.Net**: For working with networking protocols like HTTP, FTP, etc.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Imports System.IO

Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Dim fileContent As String = File.ReadAllText("example.txt")
        Console.WriteLine(fileContent)  ' 🖨️ Output: Content from example.txt
    End Sub
End Module
```

---

### 🌟 **Key Takeaways**  
- Namespaces help organize code and avoid name conflicts.
- Use the `Imports` statement to use types defined in a namespace.
- Nested namespaces and fully qualified names allow for better code management.

## **Basic Syntax of VB.NET** ✍️  

### **1. Declaring Variables** 💾  
```vb.net
Dim variableName As DataType
```
**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim age As Integer = 25
Dim name As String = "John"
```

### **2. Conditional Statements** 🛤️  
```vb.net
If condition Then
    ' Code to execute if condition is true
ElseIf anotherCondition Then
    ' Code to execute if another condition is true
Else
    ' Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
End If
```
**Example**:  
```vb.net
If age >= 18 Then
    Console.WriteLine("Adult")
Else
    Console.WriteLine("Minor")
End If
```

### **3. Loops** 🔄  


## 🔄 **Types of Loops in VB.NET**  

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. VB.NET provides different types of loops for various use cases:

---

#### 1. **For Loop** 🏃‍♂️

The **For Loop** is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It repeats a block of code for a specified number of times.  

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
For counter = startValue To endValue
    ' Code to execute
Next
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
For i = 1 To 5
    Console.WriteLine("Iteration: " & i)  ' 🖨️ Output: Iteration: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Next
```

---

#### 2. **For Each Loop** 🔄

The **For Each Loop** is used to iterate through each element in an array or collection. It is ideal when you don't know the exact number of iterations and want to work with each element.  

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
For Each item In collection
    ' Code to execute
Next
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim fruits() As String = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"}  ' 🍎🍌🍒 Array of fruits
For Each fruit In fruits
    Console.WriteLine(fruit)  ' 🖨️ Output: Apple, Banana, Cherry
Next
```

---

#### 3. **While Loop** ⏳

The **While Loop** repeats a block of code as long as the given condition is `True`. It is useful when you don't know how many times the loop should run.  

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
While condition
    ' Code to execute
End While
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim count As Integer = 0
While count < 3
    Console.WriteLine("Count: " & count)  ' 🖨️ Output: Count: 0, Count: 1, Count: 2
    count += 1
End While
```

---

#### 4. **Do While Loop** 🔄⏳

The **Do While Loop** executes the code first, and then checks the condition. It continues looping as long as the condition is `True`.  

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Do
    ' Code to execute
Loop While condition
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim count As Integer = 0
Do
    Console.WriteLine("Count: " & count)  ' 🖨️ Output: Count: 0, Count: 1, Count: 2
    count += 1
Loop While count < 3
```

---

#### 5. **Do Until Loop** ⏳🔄

The **Do Until Loop** is similar to the `Do While Loop`, but it continues looping until the condition becomes `True` (i.e., it loops while the condition is `False`).  

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Do
    ' Code to execute
Loop Until condition
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim count As Integer = 0
Do
    Console.WriteLine("Count: " & count)  ' 🖨️ Output: Count: 0, Count: 1, Count: 2
    count += 1
Loop Until count = 3
```

---

#### 6. **Exit Loop (Exit For/Exit Do)** 🚪

The **Exit Loop** statement allows you to immediately exit a loop before it finishes all its iterations. You can use it in any loop (For, While, Do).  

**Example**:  
```vb.net
For i = 1 To 10
    If i = 5 Then
        Exit For  ' 🏃‍♂️ Exit the loop when i = 5
    End If
    Console.WriteLine(i)  ' 🖨️ Output: 1, 2, 3, 4
Next
```

### 🧠 **Choosing the Right Loop**  
- **For Loop**: When you know the exact number of iterations.  
- **For Each Loop**: When you want to iterate through each element in a collection or array.  
- **While Loop**: When you want to repeat the loop as long as a condition is true, but you don't know how many iterations beforehand.  
- **Do While/Do Until Loop**: When you need the loop to execute at least once before checking the condition.

### **4. Functions and Subroutines** 🧩  

#### **Function**:  
Returns a value.  
```vb.net
Function FunctionName(ByVal parameter As DataType) As ReturnType
    ' Code to execute
    Return value
End Function
```
**Example**:  
```vb.net
Function AddNumbers(a As Integer, b As Integer) As Integer
    Return a + b
End Function
```

#### **Subroutine**:  
Does not return a value.  
```vb.net
Sub SubroutineName()
    ' Code to execute
End Sub
```
**Example**:  
```vb.net
Sub Greet()
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!")
End Sub
```

### **5. Comments** ✍️  
**Single-line Comment**:  
```vb.net
' This is a single-line comment
```

**Multi-line Comment**:  
```vb.net
' This is a comment
' that spans multiple lines
```

### **6. Printing Output** 🖨️  
```vb.net
Console.WriteLine("Your message here")
```
**Example**:  
```vb.net
Console.WriteLine("Welcome to VB.NET!")
```

### 🌟 **Get User Input in VB.NET**  

### **7. For Console Applications** 💻  
Here’s an example of how to get input from the user in a VB.NET console application:  

```vb.net
Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Console.Write("Enter your name: ") ' 🖊️ Prompt the user
        Dim name As String = Console.ReadLine() ' 📥 Read input from the user
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, " & name & "!") ' 🎉 Display the result
    End Sub
End Module
```

### 🧑‍💻 **8. Arrays in VB.NET**  

An array is a collection of similar data types stored in a single variable. You can store multiple values in a single array instead of declaring individual variables.  

---

### 🛠️ **Declaring an Array**  
To declare an array in VB.NET, you use the `Dim` keyword, followed by the array name and the size or elements of the array.  

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Dim arrayName(size) As DataType
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim numbers(4) As Integer  ' 🔢 Declares an array of 5 integers (index starts from 0)
```

---

### 🌟 **Initializing an Array**  
You can initialize an array with values when declaring it or later.  

**Example 1: Declaring and Initializing Together**:  
```vb.net
Dim fruits() As String = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"}  ' 🍎🍌🍒 Array of strings
```

**Example 2: Initializing After Declaration**:  
```vb.net
Dim colors(2) As String  ' 🌈 Array of 3 elements
colors(0) = "Red"
colors(1) = "Green"
colors(2) = "Blue"
```

---

### 🔄 **Accessing Array Elements**  
To access elements in an array, you use the index number (starting from 0).  

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Console.WriteLine(fruits(0))  ' 🍎 Output: Apple
```

---

### 📏 **Array Length**  
You can get the number of elements in an array using the `.Length` property.  

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim size As Integer = fruits.Length  ' 🔢 Returns the size of the array
Console.WriteLine(size)  ' 3
```

---

### 🔁 **Looping Through Arrays**  
You can use loops to go through each element in the array. The `For` loop is commonly used to iterate through arrays.  

**Example**:  
```vb.net
For i = 0 To fruits.Length - 1
    Console.WriteLine(fruits(i))  ' 🍎🍌🍒 Output each fruit
Next
```

---

### 📊 **Multi-Dimensional Arrays**  
VB.NET supports multi-dimensional arrays, which allow you to store data in more than one dimension (like a table).

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim matrix(1, 1) As Integer  ' 🔢 2D array (2x2)
matrix(0, 0) = 1
matrix(0, 1) = 2
matrix(1, 0) = 3
matrix(1, 1) = 4
```

---

### 💡 **Key Points**  
- Arrays store multiple values of the same data type.  
- You can declare, initialize, and access array elements easily.  
- Arrays are useful for managing large amounts of data efficiently.  

---
Here’s an explanation of **Strings** in VB.NET with examples and emojis for your GitHub README file:

---

### 🧑‍💻 **9. Strings in VB.NET**  

A **String** is a sequence of characters used to represent text in VB.NET. Strings can hold any type of textual data, such as names, addresses, or even longer text paragraphs. You can work with strings to manipulate text, perform operations like concatenation, and more.

---

#### 1. **Declaring a String** 💬  

To declare a string in VB.NET, use the `Dim` keyword followed by the string variable name and the `As String` type.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Dim variableName As String = "text"
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim greeting As String = "Hello, World!"  ' 🖨️ Output: Hello, World!
```

---

#### 2. **Concatenating Strings** ➕  

You can combine two or more strings using the `&` operator. This is called **string concatenation**.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Dim fullName As String = firstName & " " & lastName
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim firstName As String = "John"
Dim lastName As String = "Doe"
Dim fullName As String = firstName & " " & lastName  ' 🖨️ Output: John Doe
```

---

#### 3. **String Length** 📏  

To find the length of a string (i.e., the number of characters), use the `.Length` property.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Dim length As Integer = myString.Length
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim message As String = "Hello"
Dim length As Integer = message.Length  ' 🖨️ Output: 5
```

---

#### 4. **Accessing Individual Characters** 🔢  

You can access individual characters in a string using the index position (starting from 0). Use `Substring()` or the index itself to extract a character.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Dim character As Char = myString(index)
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim name As String = "Alice"
Dim firstChar As Char = name(0)  ' 🖨️ Output: A
```

---

#### 5. **String Methods** 🔧  

VB.NET provides several built-in methods to manipulate strings. Some common ones include:

#### a. **ToUpper()** and **ToLower()** 🔠  
Converts the string to uppercase or lowercase.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim word As String = "hello"
Console.WriteLine(word.ToUpper())  ' 🖨️ Output: HELLO
Console.WriteLine(word.ToLower())  ' 🖨️ Output: hello
```

#### b. **Substring()** 📍  
Extracts a part of a string.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Dim subStr As String = myString.Substring(startIndex, length)
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim sentence As String = "Hello, World!"
Dim part As String = sentence.Substring(7, 5)  ' 🖨️ Output: World
```

#### c. **Replace()** 🔄  
Replaces a specified substring with another.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Dim newString As String = myString.Replace(oldSubstring, newSubstring)
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim text As String = "I love VB.NET!"
Dim newText As String = text.Replace("love", "enjoy")  ' 🖨️ Output: I enjoy VB.NET!
```

#### d. **Trim()** ✂️  
Removes leading and trailing spaces.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim textWithSpaces As String = "   Hello   "
Dim trimmedText As String = textWithSpaces.Trim()  ' 🖨️ Output: Hello
```

---

#### 6. **Escaping Special Characters** 🛑  

To include special characters like quotes inside a string, you can escape them by using a backslash (`\`), or use double quotes (`""`) to represent a quote.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim message As String = "He said, ""Hello!"""  ' 🖨️ Output: He said, "Hello!"
```

---

#### 7. **String Interpolation** 🔄  

You can embed expressions inside strings using **string interpolation** for better readability. This uses the `$` symbol before the string.

**Syntax**:  
```vb.net
Dim message As String = $"Hello, {name}!"
```

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim name As String = "Alice"
Dim greeting As String = $"Hello, {name}!"  ' 🖨️ Output: Hello, Alice!
```

---

#### 8. **String Comparison** ⚖️  

You can compare strings using the `=` operator or `String.Compare()` method.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim str1 As String = "apple"
Dim str2 As String = "banana"
Console.WriteLine(str1 = str2)  ' 🖨️ Output: False
```

---

#### 🌟 **Key Takeaways**  
- Strings are fundamental for handling text data.
- You can manipulate strings using various methods like `Substring()`, `Replace()`, `ToUpper()`, and more.
- String interpolation makes it easy to work with variables inside strings.

## 🔧 **Operators in VB.NET**  

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They help perform tasks like arithmetic calculations, comparisons, and logical operations. VB.NET provides a wide range of operators to make programming easier and more efficient.

---

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators** ➗  

Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+`      | Addition    | `5 + 3 = 8` |
| `-`      | Subtraction | `5 - 3 = 2` |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `5 * 3 = 15` |
| `/`      | Division    | `5 / 3 = 1.6667` |
| `\`      | Integer Division | `5 \ 3 = 1` |
| `Mod`    | Remainder (Modulus) | `5 Mod 3 = 2` |

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim x As Integer = 5
Dim y As Integer = 3
Console.WriteLine(x + y)  ' 🖨️ Output: 8
Console.WriteLine(x - y)  ' 🖨️ Output: 2
Console.WriteLine(x * y)  ' 🖨️ Output: 15
Console.WriteLine(x / y)  ' 🖨️ Output: 1.6667
Console.WriteLine(x Mod y)  ' 🖨️ Output: 2
```

---

### 2. **Comparison Operators** ⚖️  

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=`      | Equal to    | `5 = 3` returns `False` |
| `<>`     | Not equal to| `5 <> 3` returns `True` |
| `>`      | Greater than | `5 > 3` returns `True` |
| `<`      | Less than   | `5 < 3` returns `False` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `5 >= 3` returns `True` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to | `5 <= 3` returns `False` |

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim x As Integer = 5
Dim y As Integer = 3
Console.WriteLine(x = y)   ' 🖨️ Output: False
Console.WriteLine(x <> y)  ' 🖨️ Output: True
Console.WriteLine(x > y)   ' 🖨️ Output: True
Console.WriteLine(x < y)   ' 🖨️ Output: False
Console.WriteLine(x >= y)  ' 🖨️ Output: True
Console.WriteLine(x <= y)  ' 🖨️ Output: False
```

---

### 3. **Logical Operators** 🧠  

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations, commonly used in decision-making and control flow.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `And`    | Returns `True` if both expressions are `True` | `(x > 3) And (y < 5)` |
| `Or`     | Returns `True` if at least one expression is `True` | `(x > 3) Or (y < 5)` |
| `Not`    | Reverses the logical value (True becomes False, and vice versa) | `Not (x > 3)` |

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim x As Integer = 5
Dim y As Integer = 3
Console.WriteLine((x > 3) And (y < 5))  ' 🖨️ Output: True
Console.WriteLine((x > 3) Or (y > 5))   ' 🖨️ Output: True
Console.WriteLine(Not (x > 3))           ' 🖨️ Output: False
```

---

### 4. **Assignment Operators** ➡️  

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=`      | Assigns a value to a variable | `x = 5` |
| `+=`     | Adds and assigns a value to a variable | `x += 3` (equivalent to `x = x + 3`) |
| `-=`     | Subtracts and assigns a value to a variable | `x -= 3` (equivalent to `x = x - 3`) |
| `*=`     | Multiplies and assigns a value to a variable | `x *= 3` (equivalent to `x = x * 3`) |
| `/=`     | Divides and assigns a value to a variable | `x /= 3` (equivalent to `x = x / 3`) |
| `\=`     | Integer divides and assigns a value to a variable | `x \= 3` (equivalent to `x = x \ 3`) |

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim x As Integer = 5
x += 3  ' 🖨️ Output: x becomes 8
x -= 2  ' 🖨️ Output: x becomes 6
x *= 4  ' 🖨️ Output: x becomes 24
x /= 6  ' 🖨️ Output: x becomes 4

### 5. **String Operators** 💬  

String operators are used to manipulate and combine strings.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&`      | Concatenates two strings | `"Hello" & " World"` |
| `+`      | Concatenates two strings (same as `&` in VB.NET) | `"Hello" + " World"` |

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim greeting As String = "Hello"
Dim name As String = "John"
Console.WriteLine(greeting & " " & name)  ' 🖨️ Output: Hello John
Console.WriteLine(greeting + " " + name)  ' 🖨️ Output: Hello John
```

---

### 6. **Identity and Type Operators** 🆔  

Identity operators are used to compare the reference of objects.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `Is`     | Checks if two object references refer to the same object | `x Is y` |
| `IsNot`  | Checks if two object references do not refer to the same object | `x IsNot y` |

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Dim obj1 As New Object()
Dim obj2 As New Object()
Console.WriteLine(obj1 Is obj2)    ' 🖨️ Output: False
Console.WriteLine(obj1 IsNot obj2) ' 🖨️ Output: True
```

---

### 🌟 **Key Takeaways**  
- **Arithmetic operators** help perform basic math operations.
- **Comparison operators** compare values and return `True` or `False`.
- **Logical operators** combine multiple conditions.
- **Assignment operators** modify the value of a variable.
- **String operators** combine strings.
- **Identity operators** compare references of objects.

## 🧩 **OOP Concepts in VB.NET**  

### 1. **Classes and Objects** 🏠

- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class.

A class defines properties and methods, while an object is a specific instance of that class.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Class Person
    ' Properties
    Public Name As String
    Public Age As Integer

    ' Method
    Public Sub Greet()
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, my name is " & Name)
    End Sub
End Class

' Creating an object
Dim person1 As New Person()
person1.Name = "John"
person1.Age = 30
person1.Greet()  ' 🖨️ Output: Hello, my name is John
```

---

### 2. **Encapsulation** 🔒

Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal workings of an object and providing access to the object’s data only through methods or properties.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Class Person
    ' Private field (hidden from outside)
    Private _age As Integer

    ' Property for controlled access to the private field
    Public Property Age As Integer
        Get
            Return _age
        End Get
        Set(value As Integer)
            If value >= 0 Then
                _age = value
            End If
        End Set
    End Property
End Class

Dim person1 As New Person()
person1.Age = 30  ' 🖨️ Valid input
Console.WriteLine(person1.Age)  ' 🖨️ Output: 30
```

---

### 3. **Inheritance** 🧬

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and logical hierarchies.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Class Animal
    Public Sub Speak()
        Console.WriteLine("Animal speaks")
    End Sub
End Class

Class Dog
    Inherits Animal  ' Inheriting from Animal

    Public Sub Bark()
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks")
    End Sub
End Class

' Creating object of Dog class
Dim dog1 As New Dog()
dog1.Speak()  ' 🖨️ Output: Animal speaks
dog1.Bark()   ' 🖨️ Output: Dog barks
```

---

### 4. **Polymorphism** 🔄

Polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name but different behaviors. It can be achieved using method overriding or interfaces.

**Example** (Method Overriding):  
```vb.net
Class Animal
    Public Overridable Sub Speak()
        Console.WriteLine("Animal speaks")
    End Sub
End Class

Class Dog
    Inherits Animal

    Public Overrides Sub Speak()
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks")
    End Sub
End Class

Dim dog1 As New Dog()
dog1.Speak()  ' 🖨️ Output: Dog barks
```

---

### 5. **Abstraction** 💡

Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary parts of the object. It can be achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.

**Example** (Abstract Class):  
```vb.net
MustInherit Class Animal
    Public MustOverride Sub Speak()
End Class

Class Dog
    Inherits Animal

    Public Overrides Sub Speak()
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks")
    End Sub
End Class

Dim dog1 As New Dog()
dog1.Speak()  ' 🖨️ Output: Dog barks
```

---

### 6. **Interfaces** 🔗

An interface defines a contract that a class must follow, specifying which methods or properties it must implement.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Interface IAnimal
    Sub Speak()
End Interface

Class Dog
    Implements IAnimal

    Public Sub Speak() Implements IAnimal.Speak
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks")
    End Sub
End Class

Dim dog1 As New Dog()
dog1.Speak()  ' 🖨️ Output: Dog barks
```

---

### 🌟 **Summary of OOP Concepts**  
- **Classes & Objects**: Classes define objects; objects are instances of classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary parts.
- **Inheritance**: A class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods can have different behaviors in different classes.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex details and exposing only essential functionality.
- **Interfaces**: Defines a contract that classes must follow.

### **Constructor in VB.NET** 🏗️

1. **What is a Constructor?**  
A **constructor** is a special method that runs when you create an object. It's used to set up initial values for the object. 🛠️

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Class Car
    ' Fields
    Public Model As String
    Public Year As Integer

    ' Constructor
    Public Sub New(model As String, year As Integer)
        Me.Model = model  ' Set the model
        Me.Year = year    ' Set the year
    End Sub

    ' Method to display car details
    Public Sub DisplayInfo()
        Console.WriteLine("Car Model: " & Model)
        Console.WriteLine("Year: " & Year)
    End Sub
End Class

' Creating an object and calling the constructor
Dim myCar As New Car("Toyota", 2022)
myCar.DisplayInfo()  ' 🖨️ Output: Car Model: Toyota, Year: 2022
```

---

2. **Default Constructor**  
If no constructor is written, VB.NET gives the object default values like `0` for numbers and `Nothing` for objects. 🧑‍💻

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Class Car
    Public Model As String
    Public Year As Integer

    ' Method to display car details
    Public Sub DisplayInfo()
        Console.WriteLine("Car Model: " & Model)
        Console.WriteLine("Year: " & Year)
    End Sub
End Class

' Creating an object without constructor (using default values)
Dim myCar As New Car()
myCar.DisplayInfo()  ' 🖨️ Output: Car Model: , Year: 0 (default values)
```

---

3. **Constructor Overloading** 🔄  
You can create multiple constructors with different parameters. This is called **constructor overloading**.

**Example**:  
```vb.net
Class Car
    Public Model As String
    Public Year As Integer
    Public Color As String

    ' Constructor with two parameters
    Public Sub New(model As String, year As Integer)
        Me.Model = model
        Me.Year = year
    End Sub

    ' Constructor with three parameters (overloaded)
    Public Sub New(model As String, year As Integer, color As String)
        Me.Model = model
        Me.Year = year
        Me.Color = color
    End Sub

    Public Sub DisplayInfo()
        Console.WriteLine("Car Model: " & Model)
        Console.WriteLine("Year: " & Year)
        If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(Color) Then
            Console.WriteLine("Color: " & Color)
        End If
    End Sub
End Class

' Creating objects with different constructors
Dim car1 As New Car("Honda", 2020)
car1.DisplayInfo()  ' 🖨️ Output: Car Model: Honda, Year: 2020

Dim car2 As New Car("BMW", 2021, "Red")
car2.DisplayInfo()  ' 🖨️ Output: Car Model: BMW, Year: 2021, Color: Red
```

---

### **Why Use Constructors?**  
- Ensures objects are **ready to use** when created. ✅  
- Initializes object properties automatically. ⚙️  
- Makes code **cleaner** and **easier to manage**. ✨


### **Exception Handling in VB.NET** ⚠️

**What is Exception Handling?**  
Exception handling helps manage errors or unexpected issues that may occur while your program is running. It helps to **catch** errors, **handle** them gracefully, and **avoid** program crashes. 🛡️

---

### **Basic Structure of Exception Handling** 🏗️

```vb.net
Try
    ' Code that might throw an exception
Catch ex As Exception
    ' Code that runs if an exception occurs
Finally
    ' Code that runs regardless of whether there was an exception or not
End Try
```

---

### **Example** 👨‍💻

```vb.net
Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Try
            ' Code that could cause an error
            Dim result As Integer = 10 / 0 ' Division by zero
        Catch ex As DivideByZeroException
            ' Handle the specific error
            Console.WriteLine("Error: Division by zero is not allowed!")  ' 🛑
        Catch ex As Exception
            ' Handle any other errors
            Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " & ex.Message)  ' 💥
        Finally
            ' This code runs no matter what (even if there was an error)
            Console.WriteLine("This will always run.")
        End Try
    End Sub
End Module
```

---

### **Explanation** 📝

1. **Try**: This block contains the code that might cause an error. You write the code you expect to run here.
2. **Catch**: If an error happens, the catch block handles the error. You can catch specific types of exceptions (like `DivideByZeroException`) or catch any general exception.
3. **Finally**: This block always runs, whether an error occurred or not. It’s often used for cleanup (like closing files or database connections).

---

### **Types of Exceptions** ⚠️

1. **DivideByZeroException** ❌  
   Happens when trying to divide by zero.
   
2. **FileNotFoundException** 📂  
   Happens if the file you try to open doesn't exist.

3. **NullReferenceException** 🔄  
   Occurs when you try to use an object that is `Nothing` (null).

4. **ArgumentOutOfRangeException** 🚫  
   Happens when you provide a value that's out of range (e.g., an invalid index in an array).

---

### **Why Use Exception Handling?** 🤔

- **Prevent program crashes**: Handles errors without stopping the program unexpectedly.  
- **Graceful error messages**: Provides helpful messages to the user.  
- **Better debugging**: Helps track errors and fix them efficiently.  

---

### **Custom Exception in VB.NET** 🛠️

A **custom exception** allows you to create your own error message when something goes wrong in your program.

---

### **Simple Example** 🌟

```vb.net
' Create a custom exception
Public Class AgeException
    Inherits Exception
    Public Sub New()
        MyBase.New("Age must be 18 or older!")
    End Sub
End Class

Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Try
            Dim age As Integer = 15 ' Invalid age
            If age < 18 Then
                Throw New AgeException() ' Throw custom exception
            End If
            Console.WriteLine("Age is valid!")
        Catch ex As AgeException
            ' Show custom error message
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message)
        End Try
    End Sub
End Module
```

---

### **Explanation** 📝

- **Custom Exception**: `AgeException` is our own error message class.
- **Throwing the Error**: If the age is less than 18, we "throw" the custom error.
- **Catching the Error**: We show the custom message when the error happens.

---

### **Example Output** 🖨️

```
Age must be 18 or older!
```
